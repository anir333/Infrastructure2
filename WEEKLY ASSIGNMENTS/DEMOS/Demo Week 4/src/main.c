    /* 
    In Java, if you have, let's say, a class CAR and you make a variable:
      -> CAR car1 = new CAR();
      -> CAR car2 = car1;

    Then car2 and car1 reference the same object, so you have two references to the same object because they point to the same information in memory.

    But in C, it's not the same...
    When you have a struct CAR and you do:
      CAR car1;
      CAR car2 = car1;

    car2 is a copy of car1, so you have two separate objects. Changes to car1 do not affect car2 and vice versa.
